This app is intended to be used as a forearm armor mounted tactical pad as part of a Halo Reach suit of armor with the forearm tacpad mount attachment.

### Features

#### Health Data Monitoring
Monitor health data such as heart rate, step count, and stand time  while at conventions with a UI of the Halo Reach TACPAD. In order to use any health reporting features ensure that read permissions have been granted to the application in `Settings > Health > Data Access & Devices > Reach TacPad`

Without actively logging a workout session health information will update roughly twice per hour but is utilized by default to save on battery life. Future feature for opt-in "real-time logging" is currently planned.
